  title: Kiln API
  description: |-
    This API provides reporting staking data on various protocols as
    well as network wide data, staking transaction crafting features
    and so on.

    ### ACCESS

    In order to use the Kiln API, you must first get an API token
    from your <a href="https://dashboard.kiln.fi/">Kiln dashboard</a>
    (applications section). If you don't have access to our dashboard,
    please get in touch at hello@kiln.fi.

    Once you have your API token, you can set it as a bearer token in
    your HTTP request headers, and target the Kiln API endpoint with
    the current MAJOR version of the API as a prefix to routes:

    <blockquote>
    curl "https://api.kiln.fi/v1/..." -H "Authorization: Bearer $KILN_API_TOKEN"
    </blockquote>

    <i>
    If you need a development environment, please reach out to
    hello@kiln.fi to have a specific access to our testnet environment
    and dedicated API endpoint.
    </i>

    ### VERSIONING

    Versions of the Kiln API use <b>MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH</b> where:

    - <b>MAJOR</b> version is increased when there is major
      incompatible API changes, major versions will be communicated in
      advance to all customers with a smooth transition path that
      spans over a minimum period of 3 MINOR versions or ~3
      months. <i>Intended frequency: 1 year</i>.
    - <b>MINOR</b> version is increased for backward compatible API
      changes without notice, or communicated breaking changes with a
      1 minor version notice and a smooth migration path. Minor
      versions will be communicated regularly to customers with the
      changelog. <i>Intended frequency: 1 month</i>.
    - <b>PATCH</b> version is increased for backward compatible
      hot-fixes, patch versions will be communicated to affected
      customers.

    <i>
    Due to the nature of blockchains (protocol disappearing,
    breaking protocol upgrades), Kiln may introduce
    backward-incompatible changes in MINOR versions after following
    a 1 MINOR version deprecation path (~1 month). These impacting
    changes will be narrowed as much as possible to the protocol,
    heavily communicated with clear guidelines and support. Customer
    not relying on affected protocols will not be affected.
    </i>

    ### BACKWARD COMPATIBILITY

    Kiln considers the following changes to be backward compatible:

    - Adding new API routes.
    - Adding new optional request parameters to existing API methods.
    - Adding new properties to existing API responses.
    - Changing the order of properties in existing API responses.
    - Adding new event types in existing enums.

    Non-breaking changes may be introduced in our API and subject to
    modification before being officialy communicated and documented
    here. Your application should not depend on them until part of
    this specification. The preview Kiln API specifications with
    upcoming and experimental new features can be found
    [here](/preview.html).

    ### REWARDS BEHAVIOR

    - No `start_date`: Returns rewards from validator activation date.
    - No `end_date`: Returns rewards up to yesterday.
